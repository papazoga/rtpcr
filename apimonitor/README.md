These are XML files that can be used with API Monitor
(http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor) to observe NI-DAQ
API calls. This supports the Traditional API, but only
a subset has been tested.

A suitable enumerated type called `NIDAQSymbol` has
been defined to hold the NI-DAQ API's
symbols defined in using the preprocessor. This makes
them human readable in the API Monitor's output.
